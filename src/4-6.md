```sql
-- First we select your data from the ZIP codes table 
-- and aggregate or count the total number of records 
-- from the NYC 311 data
select
  zips.zipcode,
  zips.geom,
  count(nyc_311.*) as count
  
-- Then we join the tables on a common ID, in this case the ZIP code
from
  nyc_zips zips
  join nyc_311 on nyc_311.incident_zip = zips.zipcode 
  
-- Then we filter using WHERE to the right complaint type 
-- and group the results by the ZIP code and geometry
where
  nyc_311.complaint_type = 'Illegal Parking'
group by
  zips.zipcode,
  zips.geom
