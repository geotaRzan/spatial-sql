## 4.7 Optimizing our queries and other tips

### 4.10

```sql
select
    zips.zipcode,
    zips.geom,
    count(nyc_311.id) as count
from
    nyc_zips zips
    join nyc_311 on nyc_311.incident_zip = zips.zipcode
where
    nyc_311.complaint_type = 'Illegal Parking'
group by
    zips.zipcode,
    zips.geom
```

### 4.11

```sql
-- In this CTE, which has an alias of "a", 
-- we pull the data we need from the nyc_311 data 
-- and filter to just the results that match "Illegal Parking"
with a as (
  select
    id,
    incident_zip as zipcode
  from
    nyc_311
  where
    nyc_311.complaint_type = 'Illegal Parking'
) 

-- We then join the data from our "temporary table" a to the zipcode data
select
  zips.zipcode,
  zips.geom,
  count(a.id) as count
from
  nyc_zips zips
  join a using (zipcode)
group by
  zips.zipcode,
  zips.geom
```

### 4.12

```sql
-- Now we have our entire aggregation in the CTE
with a as (
    select
        count("unique key") as total,
        "incident zip" as zipcode
    from
        nyc_311
    where
        nyc_311."complaint type" = 'Illegal Parking'
    group by
        "incident zip"
)
select
    zips.zipcode,
    zips.geom,
    a.total
from
    nyc_zips zips
    join a using (zipcode)
```
